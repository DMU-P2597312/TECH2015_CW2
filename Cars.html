<h3> Octane </h3>
<!-- These paragraphs of what makes the cars special are fan opinions and also personal experience -->
<p>As a whole the Octane is one of the most popular cars due to its versatility, Hitbox and smooth handling.
It proves as one of the default cars to be a fan favourite especially in tournaments and championships.
Lots of people reccomend this car for beginners as it is light and mobile.

<h3> The Batmobile </h3>
<p> The batmobile as a top 4 would be seen as quite unusual do to its body shape but mostly
  it is just a fan favourite in design and weight as like some cars this carries a lot
of weight behind it which means it might hit the ball harder than most other cars.</p>

<div class="info">
<img class="c" src="img/Dominus3.png" alt="Car" width=370 height="500">
<h3> The Dominus </h3>
<p>The Dominus is a car that can take corners very well and has the original
  hitbox for 20 unlike other cars in rocket league. Its slight bump at the front
makes its car a lot more top heavy and can prove to be very useful when using air
dribbles (controlling the ball in the air). </p>
</div>
<div class="warning">
<img class="c" src="img/Breakout4.png" alt="Car" width=370 height="500">
<h3> Breakout </h3>
<p>The breakout has a very slick front and can slide under the ball easily. This makes
it better with ball dribbiling on the ground as its flat surface can carry the ball across
the pitch with ease as long as you keep central balance.</p>

as soon as i was able to sort out what was missing i could apply it to each page seperately -->
